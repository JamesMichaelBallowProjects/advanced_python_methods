# Advanced Python Methods
---

## Purpose
This repo exists to capture the main methodologies and syntax of advanced python coding. Some people, like me, like to see how python works by executing code on their own. You can change some variables, and play around with python to figure out just how things work. This repo will obviously need to be updated to reflect newer python versions, but the ideas should remain the same (lest a substantial change in python is expected to happen in future).

## Background
Learning python can be quite tricky. For those, like me, that need to play around with code and visualize how things work by "tinkering" need more than just to read a book and memorize. When I was learning how to do more advanced methods in python when studying for my Certification in Professional Python Programming (I and II), I decided to take free courses at [OpenEDG.org](https://edube.org/login) and then take some notes of my own.

I expect that I will keep adding to this repo as I am learning and getting through the python course. Please feel free to leave any comments about broken code or any notes that might help me or others to learn about all things python!

**This repo is not expected to be perfect, and by no means am I claiming any rewards or other monies for creating/sharing this repo. I do not accept any donations for this repo.

## Formats
This repo is primarily jupyter notebooks. The reason for this is simple: for those of you who are trying to learn python, it's much easier to just be able to readily run in a jupyter notebook and edit/run to see how changes to code affect the output.
